# CISO Sim Proposal for Small Company Training

## Abstract

Most companies tend to think that they are safe from attack since their company is reletively unknown, but this tends to be the opposite of what happens. Since smaller companies don't usually bother with  purchasing defences for their networks, hackers consider them prime targets for attack. This game attempts to show that these threats are real, and shoud be defended against. The Demo game consists of a smaller subset of threats and defenses, but the full game will have many more. 

## Introduction

The general public routinely uses networks and connects to the internet, all while having no real idea of the security risks involved in doing so[2]. This causes a lack of awareness and leads to the spreading of malicious content through the ignorance of the general user[4]. A lot of smaller companies think that their network is safe enough since their company is small, and wouldn't be a target[3]. This is a bad assumption to make, since most attacks tend to be against smaller companies that hackers believe are "low hanging fruit"[3].

This game aims to fill the gap in general information security education by providing a look into some of the threats, and defences that are employed to stop those threats. The user will be put into the shoes of a CISO(Chief Information Security Officer). This gives the users an insight into what kind of threats they should be looking to deal with, and strategies to combat these threats. In the full game, the user would be educated on most of the modern types of malware, and some of the defences that are used to detect and remove them. The demo game currently features 3 threats and 4 defences. 

## Funding

The funding for this game will come from applications to the following government funding: 

NOHFC - Northern Business Opportunity Program - Small Business Start-up Projects https://nohfc.ca/en/programs/northern-business-opportunity-program-small-business-start-projects

Fednor - Financing for innovation, research and development http://fednor.gc.ca/eic/site/fednor-fednor.nsf/eng/h_fn03877.html

as well as potential angel investors from NOA (Northern Ontario Angels) http://www.northernontarioangels.ca/en/

A Kickstarter campaign will be created to also raise some crowdfunding money.

## Cost

This game will be sold at $1000 per unit, and sold to companies and schools as a training simulation. All the programs and assets used in the game will be open source, so there is no need to pay for licenses and subscription fees. The initial costs will come from the time spent by the people working on the game.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this game will be people of age 16+ who are working at smaller companies. These companies tend to be the main targets for the threats covered in this game, so they will be the target audience for it.

## Accessibility

This game is meant for people who have experience with games like "Football Manager", where the point of the game is to manage assets and keep a balance of different stats. The color scheme is dark, with no way to change that at the moment. This could be a feature in the full game. Font size, font color, text-to-speech, and window sizing will also be features of the full game.
