## Design

### Description

You play as a CISO(Chief Information Security Officer) for a company. Your job is to have a balance between having a safe network, and productive employees. Anything that is an inconvienience to an employee will reduce their productiveness, but if the network is not secure enough, then breaches will occur and your job could be in jeopardy. In order to be successful, you must keep a balance!

### Overall Goal

The goal of each level is to minimize the damage from viruses and malware coming into the network from the internet. If a node is compromised, it reduces that employees productivity by a certain amount. If the overall productivity is reduced to below 50%, then the company starts losing money each turn until the problem is dealt with.

### Level Structure

The level structure will consist of increasing difficulties. Each level will have a higher chance of infection, and the defences will have lower detection rates. 

### Gameplay

The player starts with $500 that can be spent on initial upgrades to the network. The money increases by $500 each day at 100% productivity. The money gained/ lost each day is directly proportional to the overall productivity rate. If the rate is below 50% the company starts losing money. At 0% productivity, the campany loses $500 each day.
